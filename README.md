# portscanner
this portscanner is a simple script programmed by me (AnisJokerDz) , i programmed it using perl , it' s purpose is scanning your localhost to find open ports from 1 to 5000 ports and when it done scanning, it makes a txt file in your desktop telling you which ports are open on your localhost
